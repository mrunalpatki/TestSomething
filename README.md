This is purely a test repository I have created to play around. Some useful stuff that can be done to make using git and command line seamlessly

* Set up your ssh-agent. This will help your dev box to push code to remote repository without having to be annoyed by the userName and password prompt
* Set up alias for long commands.
* Set up Atom/Sublime text to integrate with your remote repository.
